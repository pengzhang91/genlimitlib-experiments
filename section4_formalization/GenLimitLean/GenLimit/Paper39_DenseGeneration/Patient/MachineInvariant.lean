# Invariants of the semantic patient-scope machine

This file proves that the state machine in
`GenLimit.Paper39_DenseGeneration.Patient.Machine` follows
the paper's mathematical model whenever the adversary stream presents one of
the candidate languages.  The statements separate local transition facts
from the global run invariant so later validity and charging arguments can use
the branch information directly.

/-- If the old focus survives one more observation, criticality of every
language in the old scope is unchanged.  The old focus being maximal is the
key hypothesis: every old critical language contains it and therefore also
survives. -/
