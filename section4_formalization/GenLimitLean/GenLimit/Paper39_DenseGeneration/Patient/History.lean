# Recurrence and history facts for the patient-scope machine

This module derives facts that depend only on the recurrence in
`PatientMachine.processRound`.  They are kept separate from the semantic
focus/scope invariants used to prove eventual validity.

Because `PatientMachine` is total on arbitrary streams, its off-model
backtracking fallback can increment `tau` while retaining the old focus when
no consistent language exists.  Thus the unrestricted converse “unchanged
focus implies unchanged `tau`” is false.  Below it is stated under the natural
condition that the old focus remains consistent; a presentation-dependent
version can instead discharge the off-model branch using existence of the
true consistent language.
