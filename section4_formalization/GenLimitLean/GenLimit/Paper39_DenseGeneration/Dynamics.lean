# Fixed-scope dynamics of recursive criticality

This module records the local invariants used by the patient-scope state
machine.  Consistency can only be lost as the sample grows.  Nevertheless, if
the current focus remains consistent, then every old critical language in the
same fixed scope remains consistent: the focus is contained in all earlier
critical languages.  The recursive definition of `RecursiveCritical` then
implies that every critical status, and hence the focus, is unchanged in that
scope.

The main results are stated for arbitrary times `t ≤ u`; the one-step version
`fixed_scope_one_step` specializes them to the arrival of one new sample.

/-- If a later-indexed old critical language remains consistent, then every
earlier old critical language remains consistent as well.  This is the local
descending-chain argument behind the patient-scope focus invariant.

No ordering assumption on `t` and `u` is needed: the conclusion follows just
from the static inclusion `C f ⊆ C i` and consistency of `f` at `u`. -/

This lemma isolates the induction on Definition 3.2.  The patient-scope
