# Weighted-star metrics

Several Paper21 diagnostics use the same elementary geometry: every point is
assigned a nonnegative arm length, and the distance between two distinct
points is the sum of their arm lengths.  This module contains the shared
metric verification; individual diagnostics retain their own point types and
weight functions.
