# Finite and countable class corollaries in metric spaces

This module formalizes Corollaries 3.2 and 3.4 of Jiaxun Li, Vinod Raman,
and Ambuj Tewari, *On Generation in Metric Spaces*, arXiv:2602.07710v1.

The printed proof of Corollary 3.2 claims an exact maximum formula for the
scale-closure dimension.  Its lower-bound argument chooses ambient centers
of a cover of a common core and then treats those centers as a positive
sample.  Definition 2.2 does not require ambient cover centers to belong to
the covered set, so that step is invalid.  The maximum can also be empty.

Only an upper bound is needed.  A finite class has finitely many possible
version-space cores.  For every such core that has a finite
`ε'`-cover, choose one cover, and take the finite union of all chosen center
sets.  When `ε' ≤ ε`, this one finite union gives a uniform upper bound on
the `ε`-covering number of every scale-closure witness.  No cover center is
ever inserted into a positive sample.

For Corollary 3.4, an ambient enumeration is intersected back with the
target class before taking finite prefixes.  This handles empty and finite
countable classes as well as countably infinite ones.  The final scheduler
uses the valid semantic direction from a nondecreasing cover by uniformly
generatable subclasses; it does not invoke the false ambient-center
necessity direction of printed Theorem 3.3.

Both source-facing wrappers expose `[Nonempty α]`.  The paper treats the
example space as implicitly inhabited; Lean makes this premise explicit
because a `Generator α` must return an element even on the empty history.

/-- The corrected combinatorial core of Corollary 3.2.

The source needs only finiteness, not its invalid exact-maximum lower bound.
The result is stronger than the paper-facing corollary: it assumes neither
UUS nor positive scales nor any metric laws, only the scale order
`ε' ≤ ε` used to enlarge the chosen covers. -/

/-- Every finite class is uniformly generatable at ordered scales.

This is the strongest direct helper used by Corollary 3.2.  Positivity of
`ε` is relaxed to nonnegativity, while UUS and the upper bounds by `r` are
not needed by the valid sufficiency proof. -/

/-- Corollary 3.2, with all printed scalar and class hypotheses retained.

The `r`-UUS premise and the two upper scale bounds are intentionally present
in this source-facing wrapper even though the corrected upper-bound proof
does not use them.  `[Nonempty α]` makes the generation model's implicit
inhabited-example-space convention explicit. -/

This stronger helper covers empty, finite, and countably infinite classes.
It uses finite prefixes of an ambient enumeration, intersected back with
`H`, so it does not assume an exact infinite enumeration of `H`. -/
