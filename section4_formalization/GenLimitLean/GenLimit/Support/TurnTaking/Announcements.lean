# Turn-taking announcements and fresh plays

In each round the adversary speaks before the generator.  These definitions
record which party first announces a value and the freshness properties used
by turn-taking generation arguments.  They allow arbitrary repetitions unless
`FreshPlay` is assumed explicitly.

The API is shared by the P30 and P39 developments; neither paper owns these
basic notions.
