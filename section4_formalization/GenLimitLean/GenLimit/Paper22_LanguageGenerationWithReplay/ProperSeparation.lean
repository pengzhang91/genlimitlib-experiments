*Language Generation with Replay: A Learning-Theoretic View of Model
Collapse*, arXiv:2603.11784v2, Definition 3.5 and Theorem 7.3.

The source's hard class consists of four languages over `ℤ`.  After the
common first example `0`, the adversary uses the first output hypothesis to
choose one of two streams.  Either stream is simultaneously an enumeration
with replay for two targets, but no member of the four-language class is
contained in both targets.
