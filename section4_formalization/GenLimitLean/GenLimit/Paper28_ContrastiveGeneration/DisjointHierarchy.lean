# Disjoint-support hierarchy witness

This file formalizes the disjoint-support witness used in Theorems 5.13 and
5.14 of Li--Han--Jiang--Gao,
*Contrastive Identification and Generation in the Limit*
(arXiv:2605.06211v1).

The even and odd natural numbers are individually identifiable from the first
positive text example.  The edge stream `{2n,2n+1}` is simultaneously a valid
contrastive presentation for both, while their intersection is empty.
Proposition 5.12 therefore rules out contrastive generation.
