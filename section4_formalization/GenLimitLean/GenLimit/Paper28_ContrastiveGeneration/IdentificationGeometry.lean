# The geometric core of the contrastive-identification characterization

This file formalizes the equivalence between conditions (ii) and (iii) in
Theorem 4.7 of Li--Han--Jiang--Gao, *Contrastive Identification and Generation
in the Limit* (arXiv:2605.06211v1).  The remaining equivalence with existence
of an identifier uses the paper's infinitary learning model and Angluin
tell-tales; the theorem below is the exact set-theoretic heart of that result.
