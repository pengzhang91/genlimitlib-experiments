# Identification of finite languages from arbitrary positive text

The learner conjectures exactly the finite set of values observed so far.
When the target language is finite, every target value has appeared by one
finite time, so this conjecture stabilizes to the target.

## Correspondence with Gold's paper

This file formalizes the semantic mathematical content of Gold's Theorem I.6
(Appendix I, printed p. 469; PDF p. 23).  That theorem states that, under
information presentation by arbitrary text and the tester-naming relation,
the class of finite-cardinality languages is identifiable in the limit.
Gold also summarizes the same learner in Section 7 (printed p. 459): at each
time, conjecture exactly the elements that have appeared in the text so far.

The two class-level declarations corresponding to Theorem I.6 are
`finiteLearner_identifiesFiniteLanguages`, which verifies Gold's explicit
learner, and `finiteLanguages_identifiableWith`, which states the resulting
existential identifiability claim.

Gold uses indices of effective testers as names.  Here `finiteNaming` uses
finite sets themselves as names, so the file formalizes the convergence
claim but not compilation of a finite set into a tester program.

There is no exact presentation `ℕ → ℕ` of the empty language.  Consequently,
the identification theorem for the empty target is (faithfully) vacuous in
the present stream model; no pause symbol is added.

/-- The finite-set learner identifies every finite language from arbitrary
positive text.  This is Gold's Theorem I.6 under `finiteNaming`,
where finite sets serve as names for their underlying languages.
Gold's original theorem uses the tester-naming relation and
also requires an effective compilation from each observed finite set to a
tester program; that compilation is not formalized here.
For the empty language, although
`finiteLanguages` includes the empty language, every total positive text
`stream : ℕ → ℕ` has a nonempty range.  Hence no stream satisfies
`Presents stream ∅`, and the universally quantified identification statement
for `∅` holds vacuously. -/
