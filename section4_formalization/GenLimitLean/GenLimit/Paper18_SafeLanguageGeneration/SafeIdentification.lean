# Safe identification: a deterministic repair of Theorem 3.1

Definition 1 of Anastasopoulos--Ateniese--Kornaropoulos says to insert the
safe difference at a “random location” in the target family, but supplies no
probability law, quantifier over locations, or information model explaining
what the identifier knows about that location.  Its literal wording therefore
does not determine a proposition.

This module isolates the strongest deterministic content supported by the
source's phase proof:

* the candidate family is fixed before the identifier is quantified;
* every relevant safe difference is already extensionally represented in
  that fixed family, so no insertion operation is needed;
* correctness means that every eventual output names the right language,
  allowing different indices when the family has repetitions; and
* one fixed pair of countable families of infinite languages defeats every
  deterministic semantic identifier.

The three-track universe below is a countable relabeling of the source's
integer construction.  Its common harmful spine corresponds to the even
integers, its staged spine to successively exposed negative integers, and its
permanently safe spine to the positive odd integers.  The proof realizes the
finite-stopping and infinite-injury branches with one append-only labeled
stream and verifies its two tagged ranges exactly.

The result is intentionally named a repair: it proves a precise, stronger
fixed-family impossibility theorem, not a probabilistic interpretation of the
undefined “random location” sentence.

/-- Source-faithful deterministic repair of Theorem 3.1.

One fixed pair of countable indexed families of infinite languages defeats
every deterministic semantic safe identifier.  The true language is always
the same universal member.  Every possible safe difference is already
represented in the fixed candidate family, so the undefined “random
location” insertion is replaced by an explicit extensional representation
condition and no probability semantics is assumed. -/
