# Theorem 7: separated completion and diagonal certificates

This file formalizes the repair needed by the nontermination branch of
Charikar--Pabbaraju, *Exploring Facets of Language Generation in the Limit*,
arXiv:2411.15364v2, Theorem 7.

The printed proof says that an infinite query loop keeps populating both
languages.  That implication is false when the machine repeats only finitely
many query words.  For a finite partial assignment, the constructions below
complete the two languages with disjoint even/odd tails above the assignment.
Both completed languages are infinite, all recorded answers are preserved,
and their intersection contains only words that the assignment explicitly
put in both languages.

The second half packages the two exact possible infinite-stage outcomes.
A `MembershipNonterminationCertificate` is a legal infinite language pair and
exact presentation on which one round has no output.  A
`MembershipDiagonalCertificate` covers the alternative in which all phases
terminate: it has an injective common positive prefix of every finite length,
a faithful completed execution at each phase, and an output outside the
completed intersection.  Either certificate contradicts the exact
non-uniform guarantee.  We prove that constructing one of the two for every
deterministic machine implies the literal `TheoremSevenStatement`.

Thus no finite-transcript or presentation-extension step remains implicit.
`MembershipQueryGlobalDiagonal` constructs the terminating certificate
directly under the contradictory universal guarantee, which supplies finite
termination on every temporary infinite completion.
