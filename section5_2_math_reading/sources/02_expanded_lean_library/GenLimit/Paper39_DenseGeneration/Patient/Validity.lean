# Validity of the semantic patient-scope machine

This file proves Lemma 3.11 for the semantic machine.  The proof has two
parts.  First, after consistency stabilizes on the finite target prefix, a
scope not yet containing the target must eventually increase.  Second, once
the target is critical and lies in scope, every later transition keeps it in
scope.  The selected focus is then contained in the target, so every output is
a fresh target element.
