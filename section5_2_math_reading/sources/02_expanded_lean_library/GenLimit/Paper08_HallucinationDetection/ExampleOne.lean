# The multiples example

This module formalizes Example 1 of Karbasi--Montasser--Sous--Velegkas.
Positive integers are encoded by their predecessor, so paper language
`L_i = {i, 2i, 3i, ...}` is Lean index `i - 1`.

The two containment calculations in the example are correct.  The sentence
immediately after the example, however, says that Theorem 2.1 and Angluin's
characterization imply that this collection has no hallucination detector.
That sentence is false: the singleton `{i}` is a tell-tale for `L_i`.
Consequently the collection is identifiable and hallucination-detectable.
The declarations below kernel-check both the displayed calculations and this
counterdiagnosis.
