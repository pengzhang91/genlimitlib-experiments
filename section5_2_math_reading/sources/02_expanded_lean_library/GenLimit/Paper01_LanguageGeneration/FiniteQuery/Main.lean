# #01 Language Generation: finite-query main theorem

The generator below is fixed by the indexed oracle family. It does not receive
the target language index. For every exact presentation of any target in the
family, its outputs are eventually fresh elements of that target language.

This is the stateful, finite-membership-query Proceedings construction.  The
shorter classical construction lives in
`GenLimit.Paper01_LanguageGeneration.Semantic`.

/-- Theorem (2.1) of Kleinberg--Mullainathan, for the countable universe `ℕ`.

The threshold is presentation-dependent, as required by generation in the
limit. The generator itself depends only on the indexed family and its uniform
membership oracle, not on `z` or on a promised convergence time. -/
