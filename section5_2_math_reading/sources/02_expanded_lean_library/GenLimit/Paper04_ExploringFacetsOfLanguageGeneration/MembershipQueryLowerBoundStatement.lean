# Charikar--Pabbaraju Theorem 7: exact source statement and machine model

This file pins the formal statement of the membership-query lower bound in
Section 4 of Charikar--Pabbaraju, *Exploring Facets of Language Generation in
the Limit*, arXiv:2411.15364v2.

The existing `Generator` API is a plain function of the positive history; it
cannot express an algorithm that may issue an adaptively chosen finite number
of membership queries before producing one output, or may fail to terminate.
The dialogue model below records precisely that missing operational layer.
An algorithm sees all completed earlier rounds, the next positive input, and
the answered queries in the current round.  It either issues another query to
one of the two named languages or outputs a word.  A valid round contains a
finite query trace followed by an output.  Consequently, absence of a valid
execution represents the paper's possible infinite query loop.

`TheoremSevenStatement` is the literal computable, deterministic,
two-language non-uniform impossibility claim (with the countable string
universe encoded by `ℕ`).  Its adversarial infinite-stage proof is not asserted
in this file; recording it as a definition prevents a weaker one-query or
oracle-as-a-total-function theorem from being mistaken for Theorem 7.
